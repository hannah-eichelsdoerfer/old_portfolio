  <p>I was born and raised in Germany. Fascinated by the human mind and behaviour I decided to study Psychology and graduated with my Bachelors early 2021.
    Even though psychology is a deeply interesting field, I knew early on that it is not something I could see myself in professionally - I always craved something more fast-paced and evolving as well as creative.
    So when the pandemic first hit and life slowed down I stumbled upon some online courses and instantly was amazed by the countless possibilities and jobs there are with code. I decided I wanted to give learning to code a real shot after graduating, so Le Wagons Bootcamp seemed like the perfect environment to fully commit myself to it.
    The Bootcamp showed me that I am capable of understanding and learning more and faster than I ever imagined and it only took me a few days to realise that this is definitely the direction I want to work in.
    I don't have any crazy passions or super-cool hobbies, but what makes me happiest (next to solving that bug or developing something awesome) are good book, beers with intersting people, travelling, sunsets, and the ocean :ocean:</p>
